📅 Day 1: React Setup with Vite & Hello World 🚀
On Day 1 of my React Interview Series - Zero to Hero, I kickstarted the journey by setting up a React project using Vite, a fast and modern build tool.
✅ Initialized the project
✅ Installed dependencies
✅ Launched the development server
✅ Rendered a simple Hello World message on the screen

This setup lays the foundation for building high-performance React applications.

📅 Day 2: Understanding useState & Building a Counter App 🔢
On Day 2 of my React Interview Series - Zero to Hero, I explored one of the most fundamental React Hooks: useState.

✅ Learned how useState helps manage component state
✅ Built a simple Counter App to demonstrate how state updates on user interaction
✅ Practiced incrementing, decrementing, and resetting state values

This hands-on project helped solidify my understanding of how React handles dynamic data within components.

📅 Day 3: Handling User Input with useState 📝
On Day 3 of my React Interview Series - Zero to Hero, I explored how to capture and display user input using the useState hook.

✅ Created a simple input field
✅ Used useState to store and update the input value in real-time
✅ Displayed the live input value dynamically as the user types

This exercise helped me understand how React manages form inputs and real-time updates through state handling.

Build a list component to display a list of items

📅 Day 4: Rendering Lists using map() in React 📝
On Day 4, I explored how to dynamically render lists in React using the JavaScript map() method.

✅ Created an array of items
✅ Used map() to loop through the array
✅ Rendered each item inside an unordered list (<ul>)
✅ Applied the key prop to each list item for optimal rendering performance

This helped me understand how to display arrays in JSX and the importance of unique keys in list rendering.
