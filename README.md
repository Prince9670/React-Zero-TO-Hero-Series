ðŸ“… Day 1: React Setup with Vite & Hello World ðŸš€
On Day 1 of my React Interview Series - Zero to Hero, I kickstarted the journey by setting up a React project using Vite, a fast and modern build tool.
âœ… Initialized the project
âœ… Installed dependencies
âœ… Launched the development server
âœ… Rendered a simple Hello World message on the screen

This setup lays the foundation for building high-performance React applications.


ðŸ“… Day 2: Understanding useState & Building a Counter App ðŸ”¢
On Day 2 of my React Interview Series - Zero to Hero, I explored one of the most fundamental React Hooks: useState.

âœ… Learned how useState helps manage component state
âœ… Built a simple Counter App to demonstrate how state updates on user interaction
âœ… Practiced incrementing, decrementing, and resetting state values

This hands-on project helped solidify my understanding of how React handles dynamic data within components.
