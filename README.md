📅 Day 1: React Setup with Vite & Hello World 🚀
On Day 1 of my React Interview Series - Zero to Hero, I kickstarted the journey by setting up a React project using Vite, a fast and modern build tool.
✅ Initialized the project
✅ Installed dependencies
✅ Launched the development server
✅ Rendered a simple Hello World message on the screen

This setup lays the foundation for building high-performance React applications.

📅 Day 2: Understanding useState & Building a Counter App 🔢
On Day 2 of my React Interview Series - Zero to Hero, I explored one of the most fundamental React Hooks: useState.

✅ Learned how useState helps manage component state
✅ Built a simple Counter App to demonstrate how state updates on user interaction
✅ Practiced incrementing, decrementing, and resetting state values

This hands-on project helped solidify my understanding of how React handles dynamic data within components.

📅 Day 3: Handling User Input with useState 📝
On Day 3 of my React Interview Series - Zero to Hero, I explored how to capture and display user input using the useState hook.

✅ Created a simple input field
✅ Used useState to store and update the input value in real-time
✅ Displayed the live input value dynamically as the user types

This exercise helped me understand how React manages form inputs and real-time updates through state handling.

Build a list component to display a list of items

📅 Day 4: Rendering Lists using map() in React 📝
On Day 4, I explored how to dynamically render lists in React using the JavaScript map() method.

✅ Created an array of items
✅ Used map() to loop through the array
✅ Rendered each item inside an unordered list (<ul>)
✅ Applied the key prop to each list item for optimal rendering performance

This helped me understand how to display arrays in JSX and the importance of unique keys in list rendering.

📅 Day 5: Toggle Functionality using useState ✅❌
On Day 5, I implemented a simple toggle switch using the useState hook in React.

✅ Created a checkbox input
✅ Used a boolean state to track toggle ON/OFF
✅ Handled state updates with an onChange event
✅ Displayed the toggle status dynamically as "ON" or "OFF"

This exercise helped reinforce how to work with boolean states and user-driven interactions in a React component.

📅 Day 6: Fetching Data with useEffect & fetch API 🌐
On Day 6, I learned how to fetch data from an external API and render it in a React component using the useEffect hook.

✅ Used useEffect to trigger data fetching on component mount
✅ Made a GET request using the native fetch API
✅ Stored the response data using useState
✅ Displayed a loading state while the data was being fetched
✅ Rendered the fetched data dynamically

This exercise helped me understand the basics of side effects in React and how to handle asynchronous operations in functional components.
