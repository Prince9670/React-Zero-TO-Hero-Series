📅 Day 1: React Setup with Vite & Hello World 🚀
On Day 1 of my React Interview Series - Zero to Hero, I kickstarted the journey by setting up a React project using Vite, a fast and modern build tool.
✅ Initialized the project
✅ Installed dependencies
✅ Launched the development server
✅ Rendered a simple Hello World message on the screen

This setup lays the foundation for building high-performance React applications.

📅 Day 2: Understanding useState & Building a Counter App 🔢
On Day 2 of my React Interview Series - Zero to Hero, I explored one of the most fundamental React Hooks: useState.

✅ Learned how useState helps manage component state
✅ Built a simple Counter App to demonstrate how state updates on user interaction
✅ Practiced incrementing, decrementing, and resetting state values

This hands-on project helped solidify my understanding of how React handles dynamic data within components.

📅 Day 3: Handling User Input with useState 📝
On Day 3 of my React Interview Series - Zero to Hero, I explored how to capture and display user input using the useState hook.

✅ Created a simple input field
✅ Used useState to store and update the input value in real-time
✅ Displayed the live input value dynamically as the user types

This exercise helped me understand how React manages form inputs and real-time updates through state handling.
